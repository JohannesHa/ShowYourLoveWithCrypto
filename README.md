# ShowYourLoveWithCrypto

If you want to do something really romantic for valentine’s	day you have to put a pic of you and your wife on the blockchain forever! That‘s better than marriage. If your married you can divorce, but this pic is forever and you can‘t destroy it. We will post every pic on our twitter.

## Road Map

### 3 Stages of love:

1. you can put a love letter on the blockchain 
(it’s production ready now)

2. put a love lock on a “blockchain”-bridge with your names and a date
(will be production ready on valentine day)
(I have an exam on 13th though I don’t know…)	

3. put a fucking pic of your wife on the blockchain because you can. 
(Will be production ready one week later… Exams phase is hard…)
